- Feature Name: (fill me in with a unique ident, `my_awesome_feature`)
- Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
- DIP PR: [goatcorp/DIPs#0000](https://github.com/goatcorp/DIPs/pull/0000)
- Repo-Relevant Issue: [goatcorp/dalamud#0000](https://github.com/goatcorp/dalamud/issues/0000)

# Summary

[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation

[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the ecosystem and you were teaching it to another ecosystem participant. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how developers should _think_ about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use the ecosystem. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing developers and new developers.

For implementation-oriented DIPs (e.g. for Dalamud internals), this section should focus on how Dalamud contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy DIPs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.

# Reference-level explanation

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the DIP. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this?

# Rationale and alternatives

[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- For Dalamud, infrastructure, and tools proposals: Does this feature exist in other plugin ecosystems and what experience have their community had?
- For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
- For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other ecosystems and provide readers of your DIP with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other languages.

Note that while precedent set by other ecosystems is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate an DIP.
Please also take into consideration that Dalamud sometimes intentionally diverges from common modding features.

# Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the DIP process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this DIP that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this DIP?

# Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project in your proposal.
Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project
and of the relevant sub-team.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
DIP you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future DIP; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent DIPs.
The section merely provides additional information.
